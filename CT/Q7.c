/*Are the following valid or not?
a. int a = 8^8
    Not Valid
    Reason: 1. ^ is a symbol for bitwise operations not for power peration.
            2. there is no semicolon in the end of the statement.
b. int x; int y = x;
    Valid
c. int x, y = x;
    Not Valid
    Reason: x is declared and used in the same statement so the 
            compiler will not recognise x as registered.
d. char stars = '**';
    Not Valid
    Reason single quotes can only be used with single chars.
