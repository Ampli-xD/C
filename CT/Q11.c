//wil this code:
int x=2

if (x=1)
{
    printf("x is equal to 1");
}
else 
{
    printf("x is not equal to 1")
}

//a. give error
//b. print "x is equal to 1"
//c. print "x is not equal to 1"

//Answer: (b) it wil print x is equal to 1 as in the if statement th condition given is not a relational operator rather its assignment operator
//            so the program will give a warning and change the value of x to 1 that will be considered as true and first statement will be initiated.
